# Distributed Task Queue (Distributed Systems Project)

## Project Goal
Design, implement, and evaluate a distributed task queue system using gRPC and Dockerized nodes.  
The project compares two distributed designs and analyzes performance/scalability trade-offs.

---

## System Summary

This project implements a toy distributed task queue that supports:
- job submission
- queueing and dispatch
- worker execution
- status/result retrieval
- cancellation and job listing

The system uses **gRPC + Protocol Buffers** for service-to-service and client-to-service communication.

---

## Architectures Compared

### Design A: Microservices (6 functional nodes)
1. **Gateway Service**
2. **Job Service**
3. **Queue Service**
4. **Coordinator Service**
5. **Worker Service**
6. **Result Service**

> Note: A load generator may run as a separate evaluation client/container, but it is **not** counted as one of the six functional system nodes.

### Design B: Monolith-per-node (6 nodes)
- Six identical nodes
- Each node runs most/all core functionality in-process
- Exposes equivalent external API for fair comparison

---

### Fair-Comparison Constraint (API Equivalence)
To ensure a fair comparison, both designs expose the same client-facing gRPC API:
`SubmitJob`, `GetJobStatus`, `GetJobResult`, `CancelJob`, and `ListJobs`.
Both designs use equivalent request/response schemas and status semantics for these methods.
The experiments also use the same load-generation and measurement logic across both designs.

---

## Communication Model
- **gRPC (RPC)**
- **Protocol Buffers** for interface contracts and message schemas

---

## Functional Requirements
1. **SubmitJob**: Accept a job request and return a unique job ID.
2. **GetJobStatus**: Return the current state of a job.
3. **GetJobResult**: Return job output after completion.
4. **CancelJob**: Cancel pending jobs (best-effort for running jobs).
5. **ListJobs**: List jobs with filtering/pagination support.
6. **WorkerHeartbeat / FetchWork**: Support worker liveness and job retrieval.

---

## Evaluation Plan (High Level)

The project evaluates both architectures under varying workloads by measuring:
- **Throughput** (requests/sec, jobs/sec)
- **Latency** (p50/p95/p99)
- **End-to-end completion time** (submit → done)

Workload factors include:
- client concurrency
- job duration
- request mix (submit/status/result)
